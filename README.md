# MAD-simfeed
A simulator feed for CP4WAIOps Metric Anomaly Detection

This simulator is intended to provide typical metric shapes to MAD or Metric Manager, using the API provided for data load.

The original version will provide basic random function.  The ultimate idea is to provide different shaped data like slow growing, sine, flat line, etc.

There will also be another component eventually which can provide anomalous data.

Another feature that will be included is to have an option to produce 'offline' json data over a period of time in order to provide immediate training data.
